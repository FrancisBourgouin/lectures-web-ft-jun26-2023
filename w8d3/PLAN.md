# Test

- User picks a choice, robot picks to opposite
- User picks a choice, off robot picks randomly

# Flow

- Click on a choice
- If cheating, pick opposite choice (function)
- If not cheating, pick random (function)
- Compare the results (functions)
- Show the relevant message

## Unit

Testing a singular thing, testing a function, testing a component

- pickOppositeChoice
- pickRandomChoice
- compareResults

- Robot Component
- Result Component

## Integration

Test how multiple components or functions are interacting together

- Game Flow (Click on a choice, view the result)
- Game Flow (Click on robot, then a choice, view the result)

## End to end

Very similar to integration, about user stories, ux flows
